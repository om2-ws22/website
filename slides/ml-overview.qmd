## Machine Learning

![](images/overview/fig-1-2-patterns.png)


## Machine Learning characteristics

Machine learning is an approach to (1) learn (2) complex patterns from (3) existing data and use these patterns to make (4) predictions on (5) unseen data.


## When to use Machine Learning

- The system has the capacity to learn  

- There are patterns to learn, and they are complex  

- Data is available, or itâ€™s possible to collect data

- It's a predicitve problem

- Unseen data shares patterns with the training data



## Typical Machine Learning Use Cases

- Recommender system   

- Machine translation 

- Computer vision

- Chat bots

## Business and ML Objectives

- Goal of any project is to increase profits

  - **Directly**: Increasing sales and cutting costs

  - **Indirectly**: e.g., higher customer satisfaction and increasing traffic on a website

- You need to tie the performance of an ML system to the overall business performance


## Netflix Recommender example

- Business metric: subscription cancellation rate

- Netflix measures the performance of their recommender system using take-rate: the number of quality plays divided by the number of recommendations a user sees

- The higher the take-rate, the better the recommender system

- A higher take-rate also results in lower subscription cancellation rates

## A/B Testing  

- Use experiments to learn how ML metrics influence business metrics

- A/B testing to choose the model that leads to better business metrics 

- Regardless of whether this model has better ML metrics.

## Types of ML Tasks

![](images/overview/fig-2-3-ml-types.png)

## Classification versus regression

- Classification models classify inputs into different categories

- Regression models output a continuous value

## Binary versus multiclass classification

- Binary
  - Only two possible classes

- Multiclass classification
  - More than two classes


## Multiclass versus multilabel classification

- Binary and multiclass classification 
  - Example belongs to one class

- Multilabel classification problem
  - Example can belong to multiple classes
