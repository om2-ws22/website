📄 Homework 1: Get some Tweets

1. Choose a Twitter account (preferably an active account with English tweets) other than Barack Obama's account (since we used his account as an example in our lecture).
1. Use the function `search_recent_tweets` to obtain tweets from the last 7 days (include `tweet_fields`: `author_id`,  `created_at` and `geo.place_id`). 
1. Don't include retweets in your results.
1. Limit the result to a maximum of 100 Tweets.
1. Create a Pandas Dataframe and save your results as a CSV-file.
1. Upload your ipynb file and CSV to Moodle
