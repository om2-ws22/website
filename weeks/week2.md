### Git

We need Git for our course. To see if Git is already installed on your machine, you can go in the command line (on Windows), or in the terminal (on Mac) and type this command:

```bash
git --version
```

If you don't see the version, you need to install Git

- 💾 Mac: Option 1: you can install Apple's [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12), which includes Git. Option 2: Only install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) (in that case I recommend to use homebrew)

- 💾 Windows: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Follow [these instructions](https://www.heise.de/tipps-tricks/Git-auf-Windows-installieren-und-einrichten-5046134.html)
