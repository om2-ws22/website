## Learning objectives

In this course you will gain data skills applicable to marketing. You will learn how to collect and analyze data and communicate your findings with Google Analytics, Data Studio and Python Dashboards.

By the end of the semester, you will be able to...

- collect data with web scraping and web APIs.

- use methods like clustering and text mining to gain insights from data.

- make use of statistics and visuals to find and communicate insights with Python.

- apply marketing metrics to evaluate marketing efforts.

- use Google Analytics, Data Studio and Streamlit to create reports and analyze results.


## Where to get help

- If you have a question during lecture, feel free to ask it! 
- Outside of class, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the Moodle course forum.
- Emails should be reserved for questions not appropriate for the public forum. **If you email me, please include the name of our course in the subject line.** 

Check out the [Support](course-support.md) page for more resources.

## Lectures

A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing.
Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture.

Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded.

You are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.


## Assessment

Assessment for the course is comprised of three components: 

- [application exercises](application-exercises)
- [homework assignments](hw) 
- [exam](exams)

(application-exercises)=
### Application exercises

Parts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on "Application Exercises" (AE). These  exercises will give you an opportunity to practice apply the concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. 

AEs should be completed and **submitted individually**.

:::{Note}
AEs are due within six days after lecture
:::

The AEs are due within **six days** after the corresponding lecture. For example, AEs from a Wednesday lecture would be due Tuesday by 11:59 pm. 

(hw)=
### Homework

In homeworks (HW), you will apply what you've learned during lectures.

:::{Note}
Homeworks are - like application exercises - coding tasks
:::

You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and **submitted individually**.

Homework must be completed in the provided Jupyter Notebooks in your course GitHub-repo and also submitted in Moodle.


(exams)=
### Exam

There will be one, "take-home", open-note exam in Moodle.

Through the exam you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you've learned in the course.


:::{Note}
The exam will focus on the conceptual understanding of the content
:::

More details about the exam will be given during the semester.


## Grading

The final course grade will be calculated as follows:

| Category              | Percentage      |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Application exercises | 20%             |
| Homeworks             | 30%             |
| Exam 01               | 50%             |


The final grade will be determined based on the following thresholds:

|  Grade       | Final Course Grade |
|--------------|--------------------|
| 1.0           | 96 - 100          |
| 1.3           | 91 - 95           |
| 1.7           | 85 - 90           |
| 2.0           | 80 - 84           |
| 2.3           | 75 - 79           |
| 2.7           | 70 - 74           |
| 3.0           | 65 - 69           |
| 3.3           | 60 - 64           |
| 3.7           | 55 - 59           |
| 4.0            | 50 - 54          |
| 4.7           | 15 - 49           |
| 5.0            | 0 - 14           |


## Tips for success

Your success on this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it:

1.  Complete all the preparation work before class.
1.  Do the readings.
1.  Do the application exercises and homeworks. The earlier you start, the better. 
1.  Don't procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won't know where to begin asking questions. Don't let the week end with unanswered questions. 

## Course policies

### Academic integrity

**TL;DR: Don't cheat!**

All students must adhere to the academic integrity standard. Students affirm their commitment to uphold the values by signing a pledge that states:

-   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
-   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;
-   I will act if the standard is compromised

Regardless of the course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow HdM policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one's own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects.


### Collaboration policy

Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.

-   The *homework* assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what's the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.

-   For the *projects*, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.


### Policy on sharing and reusing code

I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems.

Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration).

Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.

### Late work policy

The due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material. However, I understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Here are the rules for late submissions:

-   *Homeworks* may be submitted up to 3 days late.
    There will be a 25% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.

-   *Application exercises* may be submitted up to 2 days late.
    There will be a 10% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.

-   There is no late work policy for the *exam* (need to be completed in a specific timeframe)


If there are important circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email me at [kirenz@hdm-stuttgart.de](mailto:kirenz@hdm-stuttgart.de) before the deadline.
